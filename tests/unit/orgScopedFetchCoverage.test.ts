/**
 * The tenancy lint had a real rule and one layer.
 *
 * `scripts/check-org-scoped-fetch.mjs` flags methods that query a table
 * carrying `organizationId` without any organization context. It has run in CI
 * since the Tier 1F conversion and it works — it just walked
 * `server/storage.ts` and `server/storage/*.ts` and nothing else.
 *
 * A service that owns its own persistence therefore never passed under it. One
 * of them was leaking KYC records across tenants (unit 53): every
 * route-reachable method on `services/investorVerification.ts` resolved rows by
 * primary key while its table carried `organizationId NOT NULL` and an
 * org-leading index nothing used.
 *
 * **Pointed at `server/services/**`, the lint flags all six of the methods that
 * fix touched.** Checkable rather than claimed:
 *
 *     git show <unit-53-commit>~1:server/services/investorVerification.ts \
 *       > server/services/_probe.ts && node scripts/check-org-scoped-fetch.mjs
 *
 * That is the whole unit: not a new rule, the existing rule pointed at the
 * surfaces it always meant to cover.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE GUARDS. The lint enforces its own baseline (a stale entry
 * fails it), so the down-only ratchet is already there. What a source scan
 * cannot notice is somebody quietly narrowing the WALK — deleting the services
 * branch would take the count to zero offenders and pass, exactly as it did
 * before. So: the scope stays, and the debt register may only shrink.
