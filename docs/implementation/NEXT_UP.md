# NEXT_UP — read this first

**Purpose:** a fresh Claude session should be able to read this one file and
continue the canonical-architecture program without re-planning anything.

**Last updated:** 2026-08-12 · branch `claude/acreos-canonical-implementation-1asgvc`

---

## 1. What is the governing architecture?

`shared/architecture/canon.ts` — **the machine-readable canonical architecture.**
Read it before anything else. It holds the Master Audit's seven authoritative
layers, the nine-stage canonical loop, the fifteen constitutional laws, the
minimum canonical object set mapped onto this repo's real tables, and the twelve
architecture fitness functions with what enforces each one.

It is not prose. `tests/unit/canonicalArchitecture.test.ts` verifies every table
it names really exists in the Drizzle schema and every enforcement ref really is
a file on disk, and holds two ratchets that may only shrink.

Precedence, in order:

1. Safety, security, tenant isolation, data integrity, founder hard stops.
2. **The live repo at HEAD** for facts about what exists.
3. `CLAUDE.md` + `shared/governance/constitution.ts` (founder business decisions).
4. `shared/architecture/canon.ts` (architectural law, from Master Audit BI/BL).
5. Earlier Master Audit appendices, for rationale.

The audit was written against a **public GitHub snapshot**, so several of its
factual claims about this repo are already false. Verify before implementing —
see §6.

## 2. Where the program stands

| Canonical object | Status at HEAD | Where |
|---|---|---|
| organization, user, deal, workflow-run | canonical | pre-existing |
| **evidence-claim** | **canonical** ✅ | `evidence_claims`, this program |
| **decision-snapshot** | **canonical** ✅ | `decision_snapshots`, this program |
| property, parcel, document | conflated | `properties` god table |
| **outcome** | **canonical** ✅ | `outcomes`, this program |
| party, holding, instrument, plan, action-receipt | role-table | scattered |
| **scenario** | **canonical** ✅ | `scenarios`, this program |
| relationship, opportunity | absent | — |

**8 of 18 canonical objects now have a canonical home (was 4).**

Two ratchets track convergence, both down-only, both in
`tests/unit/canonicalArchitecture.test.ts`:

- `UNENFORCED_FITNESS_BASELINE = 0` (was 2) — **every fitness function now has automated enforcement**
- `OBJECTS_WITHOUT_CANONICAL_HOME_BASELINE = 10` (was 14)

## 3. What has been completed, and what proves it

See `EXECUTION_LEDGER.md` for the full record. Summary:

1. **Canonical architecture registry** (`9034306`) — canon.ts + 18-test ratchet.
2. **Evidence Fabric** (`7b80e76`) — `evidence_claims` (append-only) + pure
   deterministic resolution policy + provider anti-corruption adapter + lineage
   API. 37 tests. Makes laws 2, 3 and 6 satisfiable.
3. **Decision Memory** (`c863bf1`) — `decision_snapshots` (immutable) + freeze
   function + API. 18 tests, the central one mutating evidence underneath a
   recorded decision and asserting it does not change meaning.
4. **Infrastructure restraint gate** — BI152's New Database Test made
   checkable, inside `npm run check`. 12 tests run the real script against
   synthetic repos to prove it bites. Drove the unenforced-fitness ratchet to
   **zero**.
5. **Governed side effects** — `outward_actions` claim ledger + pure
   execute/replay/refuse classifier + terminal `ambiguous` state, wired into
   both mail transports. 22 tests, plus a down-only adoption ratchet.
6. **Ratchet correction** — the coverage ratchet was measuring the wrong one of
   two same-named `directMailService` modules; fixed so it cannot be satisfied
   by a no-op.
7. **Security** — the `/api/admin` MFA gate protected 2 of 7 surfaces because it
   was registered below five of them. Moved above all of them, with a
   source-order regression gate.
8. **Adoption** — the bulk-mail path now passes a durable
   `mailing-order:{orderId}:lead:{leadId}` key; adoption ratchet 4 → 2.
9. **Scenario** (layer 4) — `scenarios`, immutable and engine-versioned, wired
   into Decision Memory so a decision freezes the economics as well as the
   evidence. 19 tests.
10. **Honest send coverage** — `emailService.sendEmail` accepts a key; the
    coverage ratchet widened 2 → 61 because the measurement got honest, not
    because anything got worse.
11. **Outcome** (layer 7) — `outcomes` + variance as a pure projection over
    what the decision froze. **The customer-side canonical loop now runs end to
    end: evidence → scenario → decision → outcome.** 22 tests.
12. **Second economics engine** (BI191) — the registry is passed in rather than
    global, so `note_payoff` registers from server-side without relocating
    statute-adjacent code. Two structurally different engines, overlapping in
    no metric.

Gate state at last commit: `npm run check` PASS (22 lints), tsc clean,
reachability at baseline 654, every ratchet at baseline, and the **full unit
suite green — 653 files, 8,508 tests, 1 skipped, 0 failures.**

A 24-agent reconnaissance sweep (12 layer readers + 12 adversarial verifiers)
ran against the repo during this program. Its most valuable output was the
adversarial pass: it caught the MFA ordering defect (unit 7), and it correctly
refuted a large number of its own layer reports, several of which had been
generated against a tree that this program was actively changing underneath
them. Treat any inherited "ABSENT" finding as needing re-verification against
HEAD before it is acted on.

## 4. The next highest-value unblocked task

**Register the remaining vertical engines**, then prompt for outcomes.

BI191 is now satisfied at the contract level: two structurally different engines
(`land_deal`, a cash-flow series; `note_payoff`, date-driven day-count accrual)
share one metric vocabulary and overlap in no metric. Option (b) from the
previous plan was taken — the registry is passed in rather than global — so no
regulated code moved.

In order:
- **Flip / BRRRR / multifamily NOI** — each computes inline today. Extract to a
  pure function, add an `EngineSpec` with a `compute`, and register it in
  `server/services/economics/engines/index.ts`. The pattern is now two examples
  deep, so this is mechanical rather than exploratory.
- **Prompt for outcomes.** Nothing asks a customer to record one, so the
  Decision→Outcome loop closes only when someone chooses to close it. The
  founder plane's due-outcome sweep (`outcomeLedger` / `decisionEval`) is the
  pattern to study — do not invent a second one.
- **Calibration across decisions** — the layer above a single variance.
- **SMS + e-sign transports**, then widen `PROTECTABLE_SENDS` to count them.
  The transport must be wired FIRST, or the ratchet becomes unlowerable and its
  own test fails.
- **Prompt for outcomes.** Nothing asks a customer to record one, so the loop
  closes only when someone chooses to close it. The founder plane's due-outcome
  sweep (`outcomeLedger` / `decisionEval`) is the pattern to study.
- **Calibration across decisions** — the layer above a single variance.
- **SMS + e-sign transports**, then widen `PROTECTABLE_SENDS` to count them.
  The transport must be wired FIRST, or the ratchet becomes unlowerable and its
  own test fails.

Note the table-count ratchet is strict down-only (currently 759, north star
≤450) — a new table needs a deliberate bump with a written justification in
`scripts/ratchets/table-count.json`.

## 5. What must NOT be rebuilt or reconsidered

- **Do not create a second receipt system.** Generalise
  `autopilot/proofReceipt.ts`.
- **Do not create a second evidence-acquisition architecture.** The provider
  registry (cache, circuit breaker, credit deduction, licence gating) is real
  and good. The Evidence Fabric only *records* what it learned.
- **Do not add a source-registry, predicate or resolved-value table.** Sources
  live in `data-licenses.ts` (code), predicates in `shared/evidence/claim.ts`
  (typed registry), and the resolved value is a pure recomputable projection.
- **Do not reuse a `solene_*` or founder decision table for customer state.**
  BI5: Founder OS is a control plane, not a second product database.
- **Do not relitigate the DO-NOT-DO list** in `CLAUDE.md` — five customer doors,
  four founder doors, no new nav entries, no platform money custody, BYO send
  rails, no residential-comps data plane, refuse-not-fabricate, founder-only
  hard stops. Only the founder can rescind one.
- **Do not raise a ratchet baseline to make a gate pass.** Fix the occurrence.
  When a count legitimately drops, lower it in the same commit.

## 6. Audit claims that HEAD disproves

The Master Audit inspected a public GitHub page, not the source. Correct before
acting on any of these:

| Audit says | HEAD says |
|---|---|
| ActionReceipt is absent | Exists, hash-chained + prediction-sealed, but only on the founder plane |
| Evidence has no provenance | Acquisition-side provenance is strong (`LookupResult`, `DATA_LICENSE_REGISTER`); it died at the *write*, which is now fixed |
| No kernel/pack seam | Exists (`autopilot/domainPack.ts` + `check-kernel-boundary.mjs`) — on the founder plane; the customer side still has none |
| README names Pax/Sophie/Atlas | Still true, and still worth reconciling — but there are more agent identities than the README lists |

## 7. Standing verification discipline

From `CLAUDE.md`, and it has bitten this repo repeatedly: **a green agent report
is a hypothesis.** Run the gates yourself. Hunt "built but unwired" specifically
— new route files never mounted, services with zero call sites, schema without
migrations. `npm run lint:reachability` catches it and caught this program twice.
